<h1>Intro</h1>
This is a challenge Module from the Complete 2023 Web-dev course created by Dr.Angela Yu.

In this challenge Module our goal is to try and recreate the Simon Game famously known by many kids where you try and memorize a sequence of patterns that keeps
increasing each round.

I will also be using jQuery as a supplement to practice using other libraries instead of plain vanilla js.
